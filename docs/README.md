# Cash Stack Benchmark Tests


## Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this document is to describe a protocol for benchmarking and testing [the BCH full stack of software](https://troutsblog.com/research/bitcoin-cash/how-to-bch-full-stack-developer), the system-as-a-whole. The scope of the work is to assemble a collection of standardized virtual private servers (VPS) and run a standardized command line application against that collection. The deliverable is test data that can be compared to previous and future results, in order to accurately price cloud services.

## Test System
The diagram below illustrates the wiring of the benchmarking system. Using Digital Ocean, the cost of the system is $170 per month. The goal is to be able to serve 12 requests per second with this system, but a range of throughput around that number should be tested.

An advantage of breaking up the test system into discrete ‘blocks’ is that it allows isolated study of each of the system’s subcomponents. It allows identification and characterization of bottlenecks as they form at different levels of throughput.

The final product will probably be operated using Kubernetes to more efficiently use computing resources, but the auto-managed capability of Kubernetes is not advantageous for isolating and studying bottlenecks.
Test Protocol
As can be seen in Appendix 2, an ideal wallet will generate 12 API requests when sending an SLP token. Real world wallet requests can be significantly higher. The ideal wallet in the appendix has 1 token UTXO and 1 BCH UTXO. It sends the token to itself.

Because the wallet is so simple and generating the transaction is simple, easy to reproduce, and easy to stage, it makes a good blueprint for a standardized test. A series of public addresses can be staged and scaled in order to simulate real-world conditions, patterns, and throughput.


The Basic Math
5 minutes = 300 seconds.
1 token send = 12 requests
Need to set up 300 public addresses. Make one token send per second to generate sustained 12 rps.

CLI app commands
Create-wallet - create a series of BCH wallets. The first wallet should be loaded with BCH. A second wallet should be created and loaded with tokens. Finally a third uut (unit under test) wallet should be created, which will be the one used in the actual test.


Fund-test-wallet - Send 300 utxos containing 2000 sats (0.006 BCH total) to the first 300 addresses in the test-wallet. Long-running process. Will run until it succeeds.
This command has been created with automatic retry logic. Approximately 4 minutes between transactions are used to avoid failure due to the 25-tx limit and other network issues.


Tokenize-test-wallet - Send 1 SLP token to each of the 300 test addresses. Long-running process. Will run until it succeeds.
This command has been created with automatic retry logic. Approximately 4 minutes between transactions are used to avoid failure due to the 25-tx limit and other network issues.


Run-test - each wallet sends its token back to itself. It generates a send once per second by default, but the timing is adjustable via constant variables at the top of the code.


send-all - send all BCH to clean up the test wallet and consolidate funds back in the master wallet. Use the -i flag to ignore tokens and spend their dust UTXOs, effectively burning the tokens.

Deviations From Reality
The reality is that BCH transactions are messy. Here are a few real-world considerations that complicate this kind of test:
It’s not uncommon for an hour to pass without a block confirmation. This makes it difficult to stage a test wallet without running into the unconfirmed 25-tx limit.


High or low network transaction volume will skew results. If the test is run during low network usage, the results will be skewed in favor of performance of the system. If run during high network usage, the results will be skewed against performance.


Most transactions rely on UTXO data retrieved from an indexer. It takes time for indexers to update their database, so there is always a period of time after each transaction where UTXOs in the indexer are invalid relative to the blockchain. This is why the test wallet is ‘staged’ with UTXOs, and does not accurately reflect the behavior of ‘power’ users who rapidly use child UTXOs in a short period of time.

Appendix 2 - Example SLP token transaction

Below is the output of a wallet managed by slp-cli-wallet. It contains an ideal balance of 1 token UTXO and one non-token UTXO. The transaction includes sending a token from the wallet to an address.

Conclusion
A single ‘action’ such as sending a token resulted in 12 API calls to the REST API. This is an idealized wallet; real-world wallets may make significantly more API calls.
